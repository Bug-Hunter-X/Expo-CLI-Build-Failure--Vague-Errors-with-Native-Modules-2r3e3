The solution depends on the specific native module.  However, the general approach is to ensure the module is correctly integrated into your Expo project.  

Example (Illustrative - replace with the correct instructions for your native module):

1. **Verify Module Compatibility:** Check the native module's documentation to confirm its compatibility with Expo and your Expo SDK version. 
2. **Manual Configuration (if needed):** Some native modules may require manual configuration steps beyond `expo install`.  This might involve adding platform-specific configuration files or setting environment variables.
3. **Using Expo's Build System:** Avoid directly interacting with the native module's build system unless specifically instructed to do so in the module's documentation. Expo provides its own build system, and interfering with it can lead to errors.
4. **Rebuild:** After making changes to your project or module configuration, always run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android` to ensure the changes are reflected.

If you're still facing errors, provide the following information for better troubleshooting:

* The exact error message you are seeing.
* The name and version of the native module causing problems.
* Your Expo SDK version.
* Relevant code snippets from your project's configuration files and `package.json`.

Remember, providing this level of detail will greatly aid in resolving the issue.
