This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a dependency on a native module that is not properly configured for Expo.  This often manifests as a build error during the `expo prebuild` or `expo build` process.  The error message itself might be vague, offering little insight into the true cause.  For example, you might see a generic build failure or an error related to native module linking. 

Example Scenario:

Suppose your project uses a native module (e.g., a camera library) that requires additional setup beyond the standard `expo install` command. The Expo CLI might fail to automatically detect and integrate this module, leading to the error.
